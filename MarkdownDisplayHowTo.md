This is a markdown file! There are a few ways we can see what this will look like: 

- If you're working in RStudio, hit the "Preview" button on the bar in the editing window.
- If you're working in Atom, use control-shift-M to toggle the Markdown Preview Panel.
- If you're working in Sublime, you'll need to add packages (this is a useful things to learn regardless!) 
    + Open the command palette: command+shift+p
    + Type "Install Package Control", hit `enter`
    + Open the command palette again
    + Type `install package` and hit Return. A list of available packages will be displayed.
    + Type `MarkdownEditing` and hit Return. The package will be downloaded to the appropriate directory.
    + Install `Markdown Preview` and 'LiveReload' in the same way
    + Open and close Sublime. 
    + Open the command palette, type/find `LiveReload: Enable/Disable Plugins`, hit enter. 
    + Enable Simple Reload.
    + Now when you open palette and choose "Preview in Browser" and you will get a WYSIWYG editor.
